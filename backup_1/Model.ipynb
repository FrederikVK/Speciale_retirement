    "- if one retires at age 65 or later, then one gets oap\n",
    "\n",
    "In reality the retirement age is a state variable, which is determined by the retirement choice. This state variable we can denote $R_{status}$ and can take on three different values, which is determined as follows:\n",

    "When solving the model backwards the solution has no knowledge of, when the agent will choose to retire. And therefore the solution has no knowledge of $R_{status}$ and the correct pension payment. We therefore need to solve the model for all possible realizations (3) of $R_{status}$. However this is time consuming and for many time periods the solution is independent of $R_{status}$, since oap payment is independent of $R_{status}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore we solve the model in the following way. From $T=110$ until $t=63$ we solve the model normally. Due to the timing the agent at $t=63$ will have to make the retirement choice for $t+1=64$. Thus $t=63$ is the first time we hit a time period, where the agents retirement choice will have consequences for the pension payments, since this is the first time he can choose to claim erp payments. \n",
